kvg-tools
=========

These are tools for converting the KanjiVG data at kanjivg.tagaini.net to points and strokes. Right now it only converts to pointy images in png, to S-Expressions and to single files in the Project Tegaki format. These can be used to train zinnia (http://zinnia.sourceforge.net/) models and other machine learning engines.

Usage
=====
Download the xml release of the KanjiVG data at https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg/releases.
To S-Expressions:

To csv files of the format: #stroke,x,y
